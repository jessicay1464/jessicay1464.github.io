            <h1 class="margin text-center">SEP10 Freedom Project</h1>
            <p><u>Context</u>: The “Freedom Project” also known as the “Year-Long Project” for SEP10 is all about making a website that informs the audience about the technologies that have been used in careers that  help them and how it benefits people in the real world. Students researched about the past used software and hardware. Then, students were to make future planning innovations that may benefit the career in the future. After, students were to select their tool and start creating their final product. The purpose of this blog is to demonstrate the process of me making the website about the technology and show my thoughts while doing the website.</p>
            <p><u>Content</u>: For my project, I am creating a website about a technology used in Architecture using HTML, CSS, and Github. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying the technology (past and the future) that goes in that field of career and making the website that informs another about Architecture. In this website that I made, I included the past software and hardware that are in Architecture, a future planning innovation that I thought of was the “Portable Designer” and a tool that I learned that was flexbox and grid and applied all of these into the product, my website.</p>
            <p><u>Reflection</u>: In this project, I have met many challenges, but also learned many takeaways. A challenge that I have met during making my project was how I learned my tools for weeks, however, I was completely confused about how to apply my tool into my website. This has led to me to use my wireframe and my FP google docs and see what information that were left and what was left was the tech careers. Luckily, there was 9 tech careers, that lead me to use a 3x3 grid to help me organize my project. Another challenges was how in Bootstrap, the accordion only applies for three accordion, so as I copy and pasted the third accordion part of code for the rest of the hardware part, so I was clicking the third accordion, and the rest also opens up, and I found out that it was because it was in the same id and value, so I changed the id number to one, two, three and so on. A takeaway that I have learned my project was indentations. This was because I had multiple divs (&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&lgt;). This can affect me to not know clearly which div I am closing or opening. By using indentations, we can organize our code better and more helpful than it is when a blot of code and you can't even where you want to be. It would be more time-consuming.</p>
