            <p><u>Context:</u> The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is all about containing what we learn about Javascript throughout the year and choosing a tool and learning it through tinkering, watching tutorials, and reading documentaries to help create a product throughout the year. It can be a game, or anything that is consist of using these ideas and tools. In addition, when we are finally done learning, we were able to use what we learn and combine them to make the product through the process of building an MVP and beyond MVP. The purpose of writing blogs is to jot down my process while doing each part of making our project. For instance, my challenges, my a-ha moments, or even some content that we learn. When going through each process of the game, we were to write a blog that is a way to help studnets process out what they are doing and what their challenges are.</p>
            <p><u>Content:</u> For creating my project, me and my partner Angela created a game that has a theme of "Adventure" through the use of Javascript and out tool kaboom.js. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying my tool kaboom.js in order to make my adventure game, tinkering, and learning with my project, and so on. To choose our game, in this case is Kaboom.js, it had help us create a game or any product that uses most content that we learn throughout the year and using the tools that we chose to assist us making our game and product. When we are creating this game, we were to draw, add, and load the sprites, add the movements of the sprite. Also, including the pressing the arrow keys to control the movements of the sprites, to use collide and destroy to certain ingredients when we want them to disappear when the sprite touches it. Lastly, to use go() when the sprite passes through the door and onto the next level.</p>
            <p><u>Reflection:</u> One main challenge that I have overcame is mainly the "Syntax Errors." For most of this year, I have been doing Javascript that in this case, we have been using semi-colons ";" however, in our freedom project,we have to totally use a new programming language that in Kaboom.js, we mainly have to use </p>
